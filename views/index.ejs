                <h1>A little about me:</h1>
                <p>Welcome to my blog/website! My name is Devin and I've been learning web development
                    for the last nine months with a focus on developing a strong foundational knowledge. 
                    I've primarly focused on JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and I've also been dabling with 
                    NodeJS, its libary express and React. I'm looking foward to further developing myself
                    professionaly in this ever evolving field!
